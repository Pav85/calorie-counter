The Calorie Counter Application is a simple web tool designed to help users track their daily calorie intake against their set budget. By inputting calories consumed for different meals and exercises performed, users can calculate their remaining calorie budget for the day. This README outlines the features of the application and guides on how to set it up and use it.

## Features

- **Daily Calorie Budget**: Set a daily calorie budget to manage your calorie intake.
- **Meal and Exercise Entries**: Add entries for breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, and exercises with their respective calorie values.
- **Dynamic Entry Addition**: Dynamically add new food or exercise entries within each category.
- **Calorie Calculation**: Calculate the total consumed calories against the budget and display the surplus or deficit.
- **Form Validation**: Validates input to ensure that only numeric values are entered for calorie counts.
- **Clear Form**: Allows users to clear all input fields and start fresh.

## Setup and Deployment

The application is deployed and can be accessed online, allowing users to immediately start tracking their calorie intake without any setup required.
